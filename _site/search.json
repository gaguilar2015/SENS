    "text": "The Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) is a health and nutrition survey by the United Nation’s High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), aimed at improving nutrition among refugee populations by gathering quality data to develop timely policies and interventions.\nThis document provides a brief guide to preparing SENS data for data analysis when the data-source is Survey Solutions. It assumes that the reader is familiar with Survey Solutions and has implemented (or will implement) a SENS activity using the standard Survey Solutions SENS template (will be linked when public).\nThe statistical software that will be used in this guide is R, an open-source language for graphical and statistical computing. All examples and code will be written in R, with the assistance of some key packages. All code was developed and tested using the R version 4.1.1. Please ensure that your local R installation is version 4 or higher.\nThis guide assumes no particular survey design and thus includes no design elements such as survey weights, strata, clusters, etc. However, the survey R package may be used in order to define and incorporate these elements into the analysis.\nIn addition, this guide will make heavy use of the Tidyverse, which is a set of packages and style-guidelines for data analysis in R. The two main Tidyverse packages used in this guide are dplyr, for data wrangling, and ggplot2, for plots and graphs. The ‘R Code: Preparation’ section contains more information about these and other R packages used in this guide."

The details of exporting data will not be discussed here but documentation can be found in the official Survey Solutions documentation site.\nThe image below displays all survey and system-generated files that are extracted from the Survey Solutions export.\n\nFor this guide, the files have been exported in SPSS format. The main survey files are:\n\nsens_suso.sav - the base file containing all household-level items. The modules included at this level are\n\nDemography (M. 1)\nFood Security (M. 5)\nMosquito Net (M. 6)\nWASH (M. 7)\n\nHHMEMBERS.sav - the individual-level file containing individual-level items. These include child and woman questionnaire data and modules:\n\nAnthropometry & Health (M. 2) - Child and Woman\nAnaemia (M. 3) - Child and Woman\nIYCF (m. 4) - Child.\n\nBEDNETS.sav - information on bed nets from the Mosquito Nets module.\nWATERCONTAINERS.sav - information on household water storage containers from the WASH module.\n\nFor information on the system-generated Survey Solutions file, please refer to the official documentation."

These should be installed (if not done so already) and then loaded.\nAdditionally, some objects that will later help in theming plots and graphs are defined.

These files can now be worked with. What follows in this subsection is some basic preparation of the survey data to facilitate further analysis.\n\n# 1. import files from local directory, save as R data frames\nsens_hh <- read_sav('./SENS_FILES/sens.sav')\nsens_ind <- read_sav('./SENS_FILES/HHMEMBERS.sav')\n\n# 2. add household-size categorical variable\nsens_hh <- mutate(sens_hh, \n                  HHSIZE_CAT = case_when(\n                    HHSIZE <= 4 ~ '1-4',\n                    HHSIZE <= 6 ~ '5-6',\n                    HHSIZE <= 9 ~ '7-9',\n                    HHSIZE >= 10 ~ '>= 10')\n                  )\n\n# 3. Create AGEGROUP variable in the individual-level data frame\n\n# 3a. define the age group labels at 5 year intervals\ngroupLabels <- c(\n  paste(seq(0, 90, by = 5), seq(0 + 5 - 1, 95 - 1, by = 5), sep = \"-\"),\n  paste('95+')\n  )\n\n# 3b. create the AGEGROUP variable by 5 year intervals and apply group labels\nsens_ind$AGEGROUP <- cut(sens_ind$HHMAGE, breaks = c(seq(0, 95, by = 5), Inf),\n                          labels = groupLabels, \n                          right = FALSE)\n\n# 3c. ensure correct ordering of the age group 'levels'\nsens_ind$AGEGROUP <- fct_relevel(sens_ind$AGEGROUP, \n                                 '0-4', \n                                 '5-9')\n\n# 4. create a recoded SEX variable\nsens_ind$SEX <- ifelse(sens_ind$HHMSEX == 1, 'Male', 'Female')\n\n# 5. merge household and individual level data frames\nsens_df <- left_join(sens_hh, sens_ind, by = 'interview__key')\n\nIn the above code, the following things take place:\n\nThe survey base/household-level file and the individual-level file are imported using the read_sav function from the haven packaged and saved in R objects as data frames.\nA derived categorical variable of household size is created..\nA derived categorical (ordered) variable of individual age groups is created and formatted, ensuring that the order of the age group categories follows from smallest to largest.\nA recoded SEX variable is created to facilitate some later analysis.\nThe household and individual level data frames are merged*, using dplyr’s left_join, into a single data frame named sens_df.\n\nThe joining variable is interview__key, which is a key generated by Survey Solutions to uniquely identify interview cases. In this particular context, the interview__key is unique at the household level, meaning that each survey household can be distinctly identified by its interview__key.\n\n\n*For more information on merges and joins with dplyr, see here.\nFollowing, we create a simple function for displaying nicely formatted tables using the kableExtra package. This function takes as parameters the data frame (df) to create the table from and the caption (capt) to display."

We will call these ‘Household Totals’ and they are derived by aggregating and summing the demographic summary variables available from the Demography module. We recall that these variables were automatically calculated by Survey Solutions for each interviewed household.\n\n\n\nHousehold Totals\n \n  \n    Household Totals \n    Result \n  \n \n\n  \n    Total Surveyed \n    44 \n  \n  \n    Total U2 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    Total U5 \n    17 \n  \n  \n    Total 5-14 \n    7 \n  \n  \n    Total 15-64 \n    20 \n  \n  \n    Total 65+ \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Total Pregnant \n    6 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold Size\nUsing the questionr package, it is also easy to produce some basic frequency tables, such as household size categories using the HHSIZE_CAT variable created earlier.\n\n\n\nHousehold Size\n \n  \n      \n    n \n    % \n    val% \n  \n \n\n  \n    >= 10 \n    2 \n    18.2 \n    28.6 \n  \n  \n    1-4 \n    3 \n    27.3 \n    42.9 \n  \n  \n    5-6 \n    2 \n    18.2 \n    28.6 \n  \n  \n    NA \n    4 \n    36.4 \n    NA \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFor reporting, it might be useful to create some graphs and visuals of demographic data. Below, we use the ggplot2 package to create a simple bar graph of household size frequencies.\nFor more information on ggplot2 and its syntax, refer to the Data Visualization chapter in R For Data Science (Wickham, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Pyramid\nWe can also create a typical population pyramid. To do this, we first derive a data frame that groups data by sex and age group. Because of how ggplot2 renders the data, we also make the male population figures negative, so that the male pyramid bars go to side opposite of the female pyramid bars.\nThereafter, a somewhat complex ggplot function call is made to create the pyramid. Essentially, we are modifying a bar graph and applying some tricks to create the pyramid."
