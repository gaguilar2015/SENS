    "text": "The Standardised Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) is a health and nutrition survey by the United Nation’s High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), aimed at improving nutrition among refugee populations by gathering quality data to develop timely policies and interventions.\nThis document provides a brief guide to preparing SENS data for data analysis when the data-source is Survey Solutions. It assumes that the reader is familiar with Survey Solutions and has implemented (or will implement) a SENS activity using the standard Survey Solutions SENS template (will be linked when public).\nThe statistical software that will be used in this guide is R, an open-source language for graphical and statistical computing. All examples and code will be written in R, with the assistance of some key packages. All code was developed and tested using the R version 4.1.1. Please ensure that your local R installation is version 4 or higher.\nIn addition, this guide will make heavy use of the Tidyverse, which is a set of packages and style-guidelines for data analysis in R. The two main Tidyverse packages used in this guide are dplyr, for data wrangling, and ggplot2, for plots and graphs. The ‘R Code: Preparation’ section contains more information about these and other R packages used in this guide."

    "text": "Structure of Exported Data\nThe first step is exporting and downloading the survey data from Survey Solutions. The details of exporting data will not be discussed here but documentation can be found in the official Survey Solutions documentation site.\nThe image below displays all survey and system-generated files that are extracted from the Survey Solutions export.\n\nFor this guide, the files have been exported in SPSS format. The main survey files are:\n\nsens_suso.sav - the base file containing all household-level items. The modules included at this level are\n\nDemography (M. 1)\nFood Security (M. 5)\nMosquito Net (M. 6)\nWASH (M. 7)\n\nHHMEMBERS.sav - the individual-level file containing individual-level items. These include child and woman questionnaire data and modules:\n\nAnthropometry & Health (M. 2) - Child and Woman\nAnaemia (M. 3) - Child and Woman\nIYCF (m. 4) - Child.\n\nBEDNETS.sav - information on bed nets from the Mosquito Nets module.\nWATERCONTAINERS.sav - information on household water storage containers from the WASH module.\n\nFor information on the system-generated Survey Solutions file, please refer to the official documentation."

    "text": "R Code: Preparation\n\nInstalling and loading packages\nSeveral very useful R packages will be used in this guide. These should be installed (if not done so already) and then loaded:\n\n#To install the packages used in this guide, uncomment and run the lines below.\n#install.packages(haven)      # For importing SPSS files into R\n#install.packages(janitor)    # For cleaning/housekeeping datasets\n#install.packages(dplyr)      # For wrangling and summarising datasets\n#install.packages(tidyr)      # For reshaping datasets\n#install.packages(ggplot2)    # For plotting and visualization\n#install.packages(questionr)  # For easy frequency and descrptive tables\n\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(questionr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\nImporting and merging survey files\nIt is assumed that you have downloaded and extracted the SENS survey files into a folder called SENS_FILES in your local working directory. These files can now be worked with. What follows in this subsection is some basic preparation of the survey data to facilitate further analysis.\n\n#import files from local directory\nsens_hh <- read_sav('./SENS_FILES/sens.sav')\nsens_ind <- read_sav('./SENS_FILES/HHMEMBERS.sav')\n\n#add household-size categorical variable\nsens_hh <- mutate(sens_hh, \n                  HHSIZE_CAT = case_when(\n                    HHSIZE <= 4 ~ '1-4',\n                    HHSIZE <= 6 ~ '5-6',\n                    HHSIZE <= 9 ~ '7-9',\n                    HHSIZE >= 10 ~ '>= 10')\n                  )\n\n#join household and individual level data frames\nsens_df <- left_join(sens_hh, sens_ind, by = 'interview__key')\n\nIn the above code, the following things take place:\n\nThe survey base/household-level file and the individual-level file are imported using the read_sav function from the haven packaged and saved in R objects as data frames.\nA derived categorical variable of household size is created and attached to the household-level data frame.\nThe household and individual level data frames are merged*, using dplyr’s left_join, into a single data frame named sens_df.\n\nThe joining variable is interview__key, which is a key generated by Survey Solutions to uniquely identify interview cases. In this particular context, the interview__key is unique at the household level, meaning that each survey household can be distinctly identified by its interview__key.\n\n\n*For more information on merges and joins with dplyr, see here.\nFollowing, we create a basic function for displaying nicely formatted tables.\n\n# format a data frame using the {kableExtra} package\nformattedTable <- function(df, capt){\n  df |> \n    kbl(caption = capt) |> \n    kable_material(\"hover\", full_width = F) |>\n    kable_styling(font_size = 13)\n}\n\nThis formatting is made possible by the kableExtra package. The created formattedTable function takes in two arguments:\n\ndf - the data frame or table to display.\ncapt - the caption or title for the table."
