# Sample Analysis Code for a Survey Solutions SENS survey
This repository contains some sample R code that has the aim of demonstrating that SENS survey data analysis, when the data collection platform is Survey Solutions, is possible. 

## Setup for running the code in this repository - Quarto.
This project was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), a cutting-edge new framework for authoring and publishing data-oriented documents in R (and other languages). To set up Quarto locally to use with RStudio, [see here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html). Afterwards, render index.qmd document in order to build and display the created html document (website)

## Alternative (simple) setup for running the code in this repository.
You do not need to download the entire repository or to install Quarto in order to run the R Code in this repository. You can simply follow the [step-by-step analysis guide](https://gaguilar2015.github.io/SENS/) and copy-and-paste and run the code in RStudio as you go along. No other setup needed!
