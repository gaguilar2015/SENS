# Sample Analysis Code for a Survey Solutions SENS survey
This repository contains a sample data analysis of SENS survey data with R, which can be found in [this corresponding website](https://gaguilar2015.github.io/SENS/). The aim is to succintly demonstrate how to prepare, process, explore and analyze a SENS dataset when the data-collection platform is [Survey Solutions](https://mysurvey.solutions/en/), a free data collection platform by the World Bank. This project was created as part of a consultation with the World Bank. 

This project is still under active development.

## Setup for running the code in this repository - Quarto.
This project was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), a cutting-edge new framework for authoring and publishing data-oriented documents in R (and other languages). To set up Quarto locally to use with RStudio, [see here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html). Afterwards, download/cload this repository, and open and render the index.qmd file in order to build and display the created html document (website).

## Alternative (simple) setup for running the code in this repository.
You do not need to download the entire repository or to install Quarto in order to run the R Code in this repository. You can simply 

1. Download the [survey files](https://github.com/gaguilar2015/SENS/tree/main/SENS_FILES)
2. Follow the [step-by-step analysis guide](https://gaguilar2015.github.io/SENS/) and copy-and-paste and run the code in RStudio as you go along. No other setup needed!
